sym-cache.scm
=============
  * Caching should not happen on "File->Save as" or on
    "File->Save" (for new files) if the user cancelled the
    operation.
  * Automatically create cache directory if it does not exist and
    warn the user more explicitly (using gschem-msg) about that
  * Add a function to set cache directory explicitly and do
    nothing (or write something in the log) if it doesn't exist
