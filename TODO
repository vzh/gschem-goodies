sym-cache.scm
=============
  * Caching should not happen on "File->Save as" or on
    "File->Save" (for new files) if the user cancelled the
    operation.
  * Report if and where caching is enabled/disabled.
  * If files are saved in another directory, the cache directory
    should be relative to it.
