gschem script for colormap configuration
========================================

Start it using:

  gschem -s colormap.scm

Some keys will be redefined, you'll see a dialog prompting you
about things you can do.

Change the colormap and save it. gschem uses three colormaps
(display-color-map, display-outline-color-map, and
print-color-map) and you can produce them all. Then, in order to
load it every time on gschem start-up, add something like

  (load "/path/to/my-colormap.scm")

into your gschemrc.

Probably the simplest way is to move the produced colormap scripts
into your ~/.gEDA directory and add in ~/.gEDA/gschemrc the lines
as follows:
  (load "display-color-map.scm")
  (load "display-outline-color-map.scm")
  (load "print-color-map.scm")

Apparently, you have to use the file names you've saved your
colormaps to.
